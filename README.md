This is an collection of custom PHP Formatter settings that I use for my php projects developed using Zend Studio. This formatting gives a better readability of the PHP Codes.

### Installation ###

* Open Zend Studio -> Window -> Preferences -> PHP -> Code Styles -> Formatter
* Click Import button and select this xml file and your are done.
